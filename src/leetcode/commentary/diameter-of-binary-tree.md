# 543. Diameter of Binary Tree

We need to compute the length of the diameter of the tree. The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any 2 nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

Example:

Given:

```
          1
         / \
        2   3
       / \     
      4   5
```

The diameter is 3.
